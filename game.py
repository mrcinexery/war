    Represents the logic of the card game War.

    The Game class controls the flow and rules of the card game War, played
    between two players. It manages the distribution of cards, checks for
    cyclic states to prevent infinite loops, and handles side decks in case of
    tied rounds. The game continues until one player has all the cards,
    or players choose to end the game.

    Attributes:
        player1 (Player): The first player in the game.
        player2 (Player): The second player in the game.
        previous_rounds (set): A set that stores the deck states of previous
        rounds to detect cyclic patterns in card distribution.
